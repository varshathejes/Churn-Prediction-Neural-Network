# Churn-Prediction-Neural-Network
The project of predicting customer churn using a deep learning neural network with a dataset of customer information from a bank involves building a model that can predict which customers are likely to churn. The dataset contains information such as customer demographics, account balance, credit score, and usage patterns, which can be used to train a deep learning neural network to learn patterns that are indicative of churn. The trained model can then be used to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future, allowing the bank to take action to retain those customers. This project can help the bank to reduce customer churn and improve customer satisfaction, leading to increased profitability and customer loyalty.
